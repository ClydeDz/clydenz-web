                <b>September 2015 Release</b>
                <p>I developed my first Windows Store App called Kiwi Sports, an App that fetches the latest news, images, videos and more about the All Blacks, Black Caps and Silver Ferns. I developed this App using XAML and C# and integrated various API's. This App was developed as a part of the Microsoft Student  Accelerator programme.
